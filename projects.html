		<h3><a href="frogger/index.html">Frogger</a></h3>
			<li>A ground-up build of the classic game Frogger using the Javascript canvas (with borrowed sprites). Multiple levels of increasing speed. A score system with persistant local high scores. A neat death animation. Countdown timer. Created in Spring 2013.</li>
		<h3><a href="where/index.html">Where?</a></h3>
			<li>Using the Google Maps API and geolocation, I mapped the Boston T Red Line with custom markers and station names. Also (Where's) Waldo and (Where in the World is) Carmen Sandiego sometimes appear and are located with custom markers and tags on the map. Current location is found with distance to closest station, Waldo, and Carmen. Formerly tracked live times of next arrival of selected station, but JSON link has since broken. Some features do not work in Chrome. Created in Spring 2013.</li>
